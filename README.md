# Few thoughts about this project architecture
Argh...This was a mistake not to have client and server 
separately, because I wanted it to be pure front-end at 
first... Welp, full-stack only from now on.

# server
`net start postgresql-x64-17`
password (the supereme ehem)
`\i migrations/01_create_db.sql`
`\i data/seed.sql`

Now... I know, I know local image storage for server is 
never a good idea, but this aims to showcase a template 
rather than being an offical product, thus it doesn't 
take up a lot of space anyway. 

# client
`npm install .`
`npm start`
